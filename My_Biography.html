    <title>My Background in a nutshell</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I was born in Somali in 1997 and I sooned moved to Kenya when I was barely 3 years old</p>
    <p>I went to my primary school and the first two years of my highschool there</p>
    <p>When I was in the second and third grade I used to do poorly in school and my "dugsi"</p>
    <p>"Dugsi" is what someone will understand it as a sunday school but the difference is</p>
    <p>that it was at least 5 days a week</p>
    <p>One of my teachers in dugsi used to call me "crack head" and used to tell me that my head was filled with water</p>
    <p>My teacher at school used to hate so much as I used to fail and do so poorly on every exam</p>
    <p>And would sometimes punish me for no reason</p>
    <p>So after two years of doing poorly in primary school my mom decided to repeat me in 3rd grade</p>
    <p>And I felt like that was one of my best moments in my life</p>
    <p>Now I had a new teacher (an older lady). She ignored my previous experience and </p>
    <p>She started giving me private lessons so I could understand me</p>
    <p>Belief it or not my situation changed</p>
    <p>I will continue tomorrow in shaa Allah when I'm energetic</p>
